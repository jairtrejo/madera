# Counter example
A classic counter with two buttons to go up or down

## Running
You must have [npm](http://www.npmjs.org) installed. From this directory run:

```
npm install
```

To install dependencies, and then:

```
npm run build
```

To bundle the code. Open `index.html` in the browser to open the app.

## Testing
I included example tests written in [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava), run
them using:

```
npm run test
```
